# Beaconator
A small android app and server combo that will allow you to hypothetically tape an android device to a drone and receive live telemetry! At least that was the original intent, it can be used for whatever.

## Repository

This repository will have two applications, an Android application that will export telemetry to a configured server and a sample server implementation that can be extended to push telemetry data from a device to an external system.
